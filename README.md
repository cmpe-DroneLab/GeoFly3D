## Aim of The Project
The aim of this project is to leverage advancements in drone technology to conduct research and address critical challenges. Specifically, we focus on two primary objectives:

* Detection and Mapping of Earthquake-Induced Fissures and Landslides:
Utilizing drones equipped with high-resolution cameras for autonomously detecting and mapping fissures and landslides resulting from earthquakes. This is crucial for disaster response and risk assessment.

* 3D Modeling of Buildings' exteriors:
Employing drones to perform detailed 3D scans of buildings' exteriors. This facilitates accurate modeling for various applications, including construction planning and analysis.

These objectives showcase the potential of drone technology to enhance safety, disaster management, and urban development through precise data collection and analysis.

## Approach to Achieving Our Aims
### Detection and Mapping of Earthquake-Induced Fissures and Landslides:
To achieve this objective, we plan to employ the following approach:

* Autonomous Drone Scanning:
Utilize drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to autonomously scan earthquake-affected areas, focusing on potential fissures and landslides.

* Photographic Documentation:
Capture multiple high-quality images of the area, enabling comprehensive documentation and analysis of fissures and landslide patterns.

* Photogrammetry Techniques:
Utilize photogrammetry methods to reconstruct 3D models of the terrain, enabling accurate mapping of fissures and landslides for further analysis.

### 3D Modeling of Buildings, Both Inside and Outside:
To accomplish this goal, we propose the following approach:

* Comprehensive Building Scans:
Utilize drones for detailed scans of buildings' facades.

* Photogrammetry for Building Modeling:
Apply photogrammetry techniques to create precise 3D models of the buildings using the images captured during the drone scans.

* Integration of Visual Odometry:
Implement visual odometry techniques to estimate the drone's movement and optimize image capture for more accurate and detailed building models.

These approaches utilize the capabilities of drone technology, combined with advanced image processing and 3D modeling techniques, to achieve our project aims efficiently and accurately.
